# Go Koans

## Cloning the repo

`mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/sujithps/`

`git clone git@github.com:sujithps/go-koans.git`
## Native Usage

If you prefer to do things "natively" you may download, install, and configure
the suite of tools provided by the binary or source distribution of your
choice from the [Downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/).

1. Run `go test`.
1. Make the failing tests pass, by replacing these types of `__variables__` with real values.

## Docker Usage

```shell
$ ./docker.sh
```
